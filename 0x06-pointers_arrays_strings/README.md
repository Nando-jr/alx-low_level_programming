0-strcat.c: This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
1-strncat.c: This function concatenates two strings using at most n bytes from src and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
2-strncpy.c: This function copies a string (works exactly like strncpy ;))
